           1. The Warrior's Pact
Born and raised in Sparta, Kratos was a fierce and ruthless warrior, rising quickly through the ranks to become a respected general. But in the face of a hopeless battle, he made a desperate plea to Ares, the Greek God of War:

"Give me the power to destroy my enemies!"

Ares granted his wish ‚Äî binding the Blades of Chaos to Kratos‚Äô arms, magical weapons forged in the depths of Hades. With these, Kratos slaughtered thousands... but in serving Ares, he lost his soul.

          2. The Fall of Olympus
Kratos embarked on a path of destruction, facing and killing the gods of Olympus one by one:

Poseidon, god of the sea.

Hades, ruler of the Underworld.

Helios, the sun god.

Even Zeus, his own father.

But each victory brought more chaos to the world. As gods fell, nature collapsed ‚Äî the oceans roared, plagues spread, and the sky bled red.
